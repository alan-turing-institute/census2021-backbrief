Technical background
========

This section contains a brief overview of the literature on record linkage and the variety of methods applied to this class of problem.

Record Linkage
------

There are many databases containing records that refer to real-world entities, such as people. There are also a variety of problems for which information on the same entity must be gathered from multiple databases. In order to combine or compare information on these entities from different databases, there must be a robust method for determining which records refer to the same entity.

The task of matching non-identical records from different databases that refer to the same entity is known as *record linkage*. In scientific literature it is also described by a variety of alternative names depending on the research community, including *instance identification*, *name matching*, *database hardening*, *merge-purge* and (when applied to a single database) *duplicate detection* (@elmagarmid_duplicate_2007).
